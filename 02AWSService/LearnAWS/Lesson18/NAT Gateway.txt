A NAT Gateway does something similar, but with two main differences:

1, It allows resources in a private subnet to access the internet (think yum updates, external database connections, wget calls, OS patch, etc).
2, It only works one way. The internet at large cannot get through your NAT to your private resources unless you explicitly allow it.


AWS introduced a NAT Gateway Service that can take the place of a NAT Instance. The benefits of using a NAT Gateway service are:

1, It is a fully-managed service — just create it and it works automatically, including fail-over.
2, A NAT gateway supports 5 Gbps of bandwidth and automatically scales up to 45 Gbps. (a NAT Instance is limited to the bandwidth associated with the EC2 instance type).






However:

1, Security Groups cannot be associated with a NAT Gateway.
2, You’ll need one in each AZ (for high availability), since they only operate in a single AZ.
