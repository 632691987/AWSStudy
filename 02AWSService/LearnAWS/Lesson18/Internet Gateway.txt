Internet Gateway
An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a logical connection between an Amazon VPC and the Internet. 
It is not a physical device. Only one can be associated with each VPC. 
It does not limit the bandwidth of Internet connectivity. 
(The only limitation on bandwidth is the size of the Amazon EC2 instance, 
and it applies to all traffic — internal to the VPC and out to the Internet.)

If a VPC does not have an Internet Gateway, then the resources in the VPC cannot be accessed from the Internet (unless the traffic flows via a corporate network and VPN/Direct Connect).

An Internet Gateway allows resources within your VPC to access the internet, and vice versa. In order for this to happen, there needs to be a routing table entry allowing a subnet to access the IGW.

That is to say — an IGW allows resources within your public subnet to access the internet, and the internet to access said resources.

A subnet is deemed to be a Public Subnet if it has a Route Table that directs traffic to the Internet Gateway.
